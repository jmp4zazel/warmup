# What is CCPROG2?
CCPROG2 is a second-year thesis Password Keeper/Manager college project from De La Salle College University provided by my best friend [@Seifer](https://github.com/Xei-pher). I used it as my first warm-up project, and it took me around 1 day and a half to finish.

I’m aware that there are bug, feel free to submit PRs or suggestions. That said, I don’t plan on perfecting this project since it’s meant to be a simple “kata” warm-up.
